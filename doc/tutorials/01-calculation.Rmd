### Calculator operations

To get you used to using R, I will start by showing you how to use R to turn your computer into a fancy calculator. We'll use RStudio's notebook feature. To run code in the notebook, you can click the green arrow in the upper right hand corner of the code cell or press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` on your keyboard. Let's start with some simple arithmetic:

```{r}
2 + 2
3 + 5
5 / 7
5 ^ 4
9 + 7
2*pi / 6
```

Notice how the outputs come out in the order that they were entered into the console. You can ask R to evaluate very complicated expressions if you like; use parentheses to force your preferred order of operations.

```{r}
((2 + 5/8)^(2/3))*9
```

There are some other arithmetic operations that you will want to remember:

#### `a %% b_`: residue of `a` modulo `b`

This is the remainder you get when you divide `a` by `b`, taken as a number between `0` and `b`. This will be negative if `b` is negative!  The inputs and outputs to this do not have to be integers, but the **quotient** (that you don't see) does.  This operation will be very handy when we want to have a program model events that happen with some regular frequency that is not "every time period."

**In math, this residue is nearly always taken to be positive**, so be careful when moving from one subject to another!

```{r}
10 %% 3
3 %% 5
10 %% pi
10 %% -pi
```

#### `a %/% b`: *integer* quotient of `a` divided by `b`

This divides `a` by `b`, leaving the result as an integer.It takes the largest integer `q` so that `q * b < a` as long as `b` is positive, and it does something similar if `b` is negative.

```{r}
10 %/% 3
10 %/% -3
2.2 %/% 1.2
```

There is a relationship between `%%` and `%/%` called *quotient-remainder* that you should remember: `a == b*(a %/% b) + (a %% b)`. Let's try it out:

```{r}
3*(10 %/% 3) + (10 %% 3)       # Should be 10
(-3)*(10 %/% -3) + (10 %% -3)  # Should be 10
pi*(4.3 %/% pi) + (4.3 %% pi)  # Should be 4.3
```


### Variables

You'll often want to store a number or other object for later use.R does this by assigning a value to a variable. There are two different ways to do this in R, as follows:

```{r}
x = 57
x
y <- 33
y
```

The preferred way to make assignments in R is with the arrow operator `<-`, but the equality symbol *usually* does the same thing.

By default, R will not print any output to the console when you make a variable assignment, you will need to do something if you want to see the number that you you just saved a reference to.  Here are three ways to make this happen:

```{r}
x = 57
print(x)
y <- 33
y
(z <- 31)
```

When assigning values to variables, you can make references to other variables that you already assigned. You'll see these variables and a summary of their values in your "Environment" pane.

```{r}
x <- 57
y <- 33
z <- x + y
print(z)

```

It is completely fine to go back and change the value of a variable that you previously defined, but realize that this will not change the values of any variables that you used the first variable to define:

```{r}
x <- 57
y <- 33
z <- x + y
print(z)
x <- 0
print(z)

```

I useful consequence of this is that you can redefine a variable in a way that uses its current value.When this happens, the old value is effectively removed and a new value replaces it.*It is better to think of variables as __names for storage sites__ for your data rather than as names for the data themselves*.

```{r}
x <- 57
print(x)
x <- x^2
print(x)

```

### Built-in functions

As with a graphing calculator, R comes with a large number of useful mathematical functions already built in. It would be unreasonable to list them here, so I will go over some of the most important examples.

#### Logarithms

To access logarithm functions, you may use the `log()` function. In R, the default base for `log()` is `e`. If you want to use another base, you must explicitly say so through the use of what is known as a keyword argument, or "kwarg".

To specify a keyword argument for the keyword "base" that determines the base of the logarithm, you can include a statement that begins with `base=` on your list of inputs to the function. Since `log()` only takes one keyword argument, it is actually okay to omit the explicit mention of the "base" input, but it is good practice for dealing with more complicated functions that may involve multiple keyword arguements, only a few of which you want to actually change from the default values. Which of the ways of calling for logarithms do you find to be easier to read?

```{r}
log(10)
log(10, base=exp(1))
log(10, base=10)
log(10, 10)

```

#### Square root

To take a square root, either use `^` or the `sqrt()` function. There is no guarantee that these will calculate the square root in the same way, but that shouldn't be an issue.

```{r}
sqrt(5)
5^(0.5)
5^(1/2)

```

#### Rounding

There are many ways of taking a number and getting a "nearby" integer in R. Here are a few examples:

```{r}
x = 3.4
round(x)
ceiling(x)
floor(x)
trunc(x)
as.integer(x)
```

Note that with computers, numerical values involving decimals are almost never recorded exactly. This means that these operations may not always do exactly what you expected when it comes to input values near where the functions change values abruptly. Both of the following two numbers should both be just slightly larger than 1, and so `ceiling()` should give value 2 in both cases.

```{r}
ceiling(1 + 1*10^(-15))
ceiling(1 + 1*10^(-16))
```
# Exercises.

1.  Let's pull up the curtain and take a look at how R assigned variables.  Here I will use a potentially dangerous function `.Internal` to ask R to tell me where in my computer the values I made are physically located. The information I am interested in is that first block of characters, starting with "@".  What can you say about what you see?

```{r}
print("Assign x and y:")
x <- 2
y <- x
.Internal(inspect(x))
.Internal(inspect(y))
print("Reassign y:")
y <- 2
.Internal(inspect(x))
.Internal(inspect(y))
print("Reassign x and y:")
x <- 4
y <- 4
.Internal(inspect(x))
.Internal(inspect(y))
```

2.  In the section on rounding, you saw the following script.  By changing the value of `x`, try to figure out what each of those rounding functions actually does. Use `?round` to look at the help file and see if you figured their behavior out completely.

```{r}
x = 3.4
round(x)
ceiling(x)
floor(x)
trunc(x)
as.integer(x)
```

3.  You can order R to calculate the square root of a number `x` in at least the following two ways:`sqrt(x)` and `x^0.5`.Can you detect a difference between the two methods of calculation?
