### Even more automation

The final method of controlling how a program executes that I will introduce is the function. A function in R is a sub-program within a script that you can run any time after the interpreter has been told about it. Though this may seem like a small addition to your tool kit, the ability to write functions gives you a great deal of power! Here is a simple example to get you started:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  y = x^2
  return(y)
}
f(3)
f(f(2))
```

Before explaining the syntax and how to use it, here is another function that takes more than one argument and has a more descriptive name:

```{r}
multiply <- function(x, y) {
  z <- x * y
  return(z)
}
multiply(2, 4)
multiply(1, 0)
```

To define a function, first you write down the name that you want to give it. You should name functions like you name variables: with descriptive and memorable names of a "reasonable" length. You assign to this a value using `function()` by the list of inputs that you want to compute with in parentheses, followed by the code for the function in braces, like this:

```{r}
good_name <- function(list_of_inputs) {what_the_function_does}
```

Whenever you place the appropriate number of inputs in parentheses following your function name and run that code, R will execute the code you wrote for the function with those values in place the the variable names that you used. An important use for functions is, unsuprisingly, to execute the same code multiple times in different places without having to write multiple copies of that code.

### Self-reference

With all of the power that the use of functions gives you, it's important to realize that they are also quite dangerous. Here is an example of a function that involves recursion to reproduce the functionality of a while loop, with all of the associated issues:

```{r}
danger <- function(x) {
  if (x < 5) {
    print("Danger")
    danger(x + 1)
  }
}

danger(0)
```

This sort of thing could easily run away on you, so be very cautious if you decide to do it! If you can manage, I recommend sticking with loops so that others can more easily see your intentions.

### The `Global Environment` and `remove()`

By now you may have noticed something about the functions that you've used so far: they are all somehow living in the `Global Environment`, and you can see references to them just below the list of variables you happen to have assigned. This lets you know that you have continued access to those specific functions, and you will continue to have access to them, even in other scripts and notebooks that you might have open. If you want to be rid of a function or variable in your workspace without overwriting it, you can do so with the following syntax:

```{r}
remove(f)
remove(good_name)
remove(multiply)
```

Even though R did not produce any output when those instructions were entered, you should see that those functions are no longer present in your `Global Environment`. If you are wondering why you would ever want to do this, imagine that you accidentally tell R that it should make the value of `pi` exactly `3`.

```{r}
pi
pi <- 3
pi
remove(pi)
pi
```

It turns out that R still remembers the built-in definition pf `pi` even while giving precedence to your new definition. By using `remove()`, you effectively restore the built-in definition for `pi` by taking away the "higher priority" version. If this reminds you of some of the issues that came up when working with kwarg naming before, then good!

### Using `return()` and `stop()`

A final note on function syntax: by default, R will return the last thing it sees in a function computation as that function's value. If you want to be sure that the correct thing is being returned, then you can use `return()`. As soon as R is asked to run a `return()` statement within a function, it will stop execution of the function's code and return whatever is in the parentheses as the function's output:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  return(x)
  print("No one will ever see this!")

}
f(3)
```

You can also use this as you would use a `break` statement in a loop to stop the function from doing unneeded computations:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  if (x > 5) {
    return(x^2)
  }
  return(x^3)

}
f(2)
f(6)
```

The `stop()` statement also stops execution of a function. Unlike `return()` stop halts the execution of the entire script, and prints out an error message instead of returning a value. Look at what happens when I put `stop()` in place of the first `return()` in the last function definition:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  if (x > 5) {
    stop(x^2)
  }
  return(x^3)

}
x <- f(4)
x
x <- f(6)
print("What happened?")
x
```

`stop()` is very useful for at least the following reason: when a program goes wrong, it is better for it to shut down entirely than to return bad information.  Later, I'll show you how to "catch" an error message like the ones that `stop()` produces and get your script to recover more gracefully.


### Scoping and local functions

Variables in R are divided up into workspaces. There is a global workspace, and it holds all of the variables that you define outside of function environments. Each function you define also has its own local workspace, that only exists while the function is being computed. The local workspace holds any variable that you passed into it by including it as one of your function's inputs, as well as any variables that you define in the course of evaluating the function. Variables that you pass in will still be around after the function is done doing its work, at least as much as they were around before the function was called upon.

If you define a variable within a function's code, it will exist in this temporary local workspace for the duration of the function's execution. After the function is done, R's "garbage collector" will notice (usually very quickly) that the quantity is no longer being used, and the part of your computer's memory that held the quantity will be cleared out. If you use a name for a local variable that coincides with a name for a global variable, this works just like how it worked when I tried to change the value of `pi`: the new value is used until it is somehow removed, either through the use of `remove()` or through the function ending its execution:

```{r}
t <- 5
f <- function(x) {
  t <- 3
  print(t)
}
print(t)
f(0)
print(t)

```

Notice that the function printed its value of `t`, which was immediately cleared out when the function was done, restoring the "old" value of `t` for the final `print()`.

As with global variables and built-in values, it is possible for a function to see global variables without them being explicitly passed:

```{r}
t <- 5
f <- function(x) {
  print(t)
  t <- 3
  print(t)
}
f(0)
f(0)
```

This function knew the global value of `t` and used it until it was given a new value in the function's local workspace. After the function was done, the local value went away, and the global value again became the only one that R uses. When the function executed the second time, it had to go back to the original globally defined value!

If a function is defined within the defing code of another function, then it is called a local function.  Each local functions has its own workspace, and it treats it's containing function's workspace as a sort of "extra"" global workspace. It can still access the "true" global workspace, just at a lower priority. How functions that are called in other functions access variables is determined by the method that R uses for something called "scoping". R happens to use a method for scoping called "lexical scoping", which means that everything is determined by _where the function was defined_ and not _where it is being used_. If you want to use a function within another function and have it access that function's workspace, it has to be a local function. The following diagram summarizes R's normal behavior:

global $\rightarrow$ loaded packages $\rightarrow$ base R $\rightarrow$ outermost function $\rightarrow$ $\cdots$ $\rightarrow$ next function out $\rightarrow$ current function

It is even possible to break this order if you really want! That said, the safest way to have one function access another function's computations is by explicitly passing everything that you care about as function arguments and never referring to variables within a function definition that the function isn't given explicitly. This approach makes your R functions behave much more like mathematical functions: given the same inputs, they will always return the same outputs. This way of doing things is often known as "the functional programming paradigm." *It is not always possible to adhere to this paradigm in R.*

# Exercises.

1.  Redefine the exponential function `exp()` to be something else, and verify that you succeeded in doing so so. Then remove your new definition from the `Global Environment` and verify that the old exponential function is back.

2.  What precisely is wrong with the following version of the multiply()` function?

```{r}
y = 4
z = 5
multiply <- function(x, y) {
  y * z
}
```

3.  Explain how to replace any and all instances of loops with recursion. Explain why doing this replacement might not be a good idea. Can you think of a situation where recursion would work better than a loop structure?

4.  Explain what the following script *will* do, then run it to verify:

```{r}
multiply <- function(x, y) {
  x * y
  add <- function(a, b) {
    a + b
  }
  add(x, y)
}
multiply(2, 3)
add(2, 3)
```
